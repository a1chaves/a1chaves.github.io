  <h1> Amber Chaves</h1>
  <p> I am a math major with minors in computer science and statistics. This is my final 
    semester at Bridgewater State University and I will be graduating in May of 2024. Over my past 
    four years, I have taken a wide variety of classes in order to broaden my knowledge and discover
    things I never thought I would enjoy academics wise, which is how I found both Computer Science 
    and statistics. </p>
  <p> Outside of academics, I am the vice president of Women in STEM and I am secretary
    of Dance Company. I am also from Rhode Island and have lived there most of my life.
